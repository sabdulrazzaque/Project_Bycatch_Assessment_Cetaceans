# Project_Bycatch_Assessment_Cetaceans
A questionnaire has been developed for face-to-face surveys to the target fisher groups. The questionnaire-based survey was carried out from January 2023 with predefined criteria of target fishers. The survey was conducted by random sampling of the fisher target group for the face-to-face survey to assess the bycatch of the cetaceans for the data collection and reporting from their fishing trips during the project life. The developed questionnaire was focused on the demographics, fisheries, knowledge on bycatch of cetacean and other bycatch species, knowledge and awareness of the protection laws or conservation of the bycatch species, particularly cetaceans, bycatch interaction and mitigations, attitude and perception towards bycatch and cetaceans bycatch, collaboration and support for the data collection and reporting. Before the interviews, the enumerators had explained the background of the survey project, had verbal consent voluntarily for the interview, and ensured responses honestly based on their experiences. Each responded also informed to withdraw at any point during the interview. 

A total of 150 the fisher were interviewed on the prescribed questionnaire from 11 villages of three districts, i.e. Thatta, Sujawal and Gwadar.

The analysis containing this repository has the EDA of all the questions asked from the fishermen converted into variables. Hence, each question is considered a separate variable.
